<p>
So may I introduce to you... <br><br>

The statuses of the observations requested for the last night.<br>

The HTML table below details which transients were requested for observation, if they were observed, the fraction of the total requested exposure time they were observed for, and their filenames on the LT archive.<br><br>

Also attached are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>
  <font size=5><tt> observations_{YYYYMMDD}.csv </tt></font> which is the HTML table in CSV format.
  </li>
  <li>
  <font size=5><tt> LT{YYYYMMDD}_spliced.csv </tt></font> which is the log from the LT for the last night, but only including the targets that were requested. 
  </li>
</ul>
