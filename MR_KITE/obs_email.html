<p>
So may I introduce to you... <br><br>

The status of the observations requested from the Liverpool Telescope last night.<br>

The HTML table below includes the transients requested last night, if they were observed, their proposal ID, their group ID, the fraction of the total requested exposure time they were observed for, and the root of their filename on the LT archive.<br><br>

Also attached are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>
  <font size=5><tt> observations.csv </tt></font> which contains the same information as the HTML table but for all SALT&PEPPER observations made (plus a column for the date).
  </li>
  <li>
  <font size=5><tt> LT{YYYYMMDD}_spliced.csv </tt></font> which is the log from the LT for the last night that has been spliced to only include the targets that SALT&PEPPER requested.
  </li>
</ul>
