So may I introduce to you... <br><br>

Two lists of the most interesting transients selected from the TNS database and visible from La Palma tonight.<br>

Both lists are ordered by their priority score - 0 is the highest and 5 is the lowest priority. These are calculated using each target's observable time, lunar separation, plus discovery date and magnitude.<br><br>

<font size=5><tt> transient_list-S.csv </tt></font> is for the PEPPER Slow Survey, so uses targets from the last 3 months that were modified in the last 2 weeks, and weights the observable time and apparent magnitudes of the targets most when calculating the priority scores. <br><br>

<font size=5><tt> transient_list-F.csv </tt></font> is for the PEPPER Fast Survey, so uses targets from the last 2 months that were modified in the last 2 days, and weights the discovery date and apparent magnitude of the targets most when calculating the priority scores. A HTML version of this can be found at the end of this email. <br><br>

Additionally, at the end of this email, there are two visibility plots of the top 5 targets from the PEPPER Fast and Slow lists for the coming night.<br><br>
