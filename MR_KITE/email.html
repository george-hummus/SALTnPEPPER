<p>
So may I introduce to you... <br><br>

Two lists of the highest priority transients selected from the TNS database and visible from La Palma tonight.<br>

Both lists are ordered by their priority score - 0 is the highest and 5 is the lowest priority. These are calculated using each target's observable time, lunar separation, discovery date, and magnitude. <br>

<ul>
  <li>
    <font size=5><tt> TrasnientList_S_{YYYYMMDD}.csv </tt></font> is for the PEPPER Fast Survey. It is composed of transients from the TNS discovered in the last 2 months and modified in the last 2 days. It weighs the priority scores for earlier discovery dates and brighter apparent magnitudes. A HTML version of this list can be found at the end of this email.
  </li>
  <li>
    <font size=5><tt> TrasnientList_S_{YYYYMMDD}.csv </tt></font> is for the PEPPER Slow Survey. It is composed of transients from the TNS discovered in the last 3 months and modified in the last 2 weeks. It weighs the priority scores for higher observable times and brighter apparent magnitudes.
  </li>
</ul>

Additionally, at the end of this email, there are two visibility plots of the top 5 targets from the PEPPER Fast and Slow lists for the coming night.<br><br>
